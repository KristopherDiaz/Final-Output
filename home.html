Animix Play is the websites that you can watch all anime that you want to watch. 
Animixplay is the best anime website not only because of all anime are there, but because of this website has no advertisement.
This kind of anime website is very comfortable to use. Animix play is the website to watch anime.</p> 

<p> <center> <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"> <img src="google.png" width="80" height="60"></center> </a>
Google is a website and application that you can search any you want to search.
For me, google is the best website to use when you're going to search. It's because this website or application is very easy to use 
and very friendly user. You can search all you want to search, you can play a music using youtube.
And also google have e-commerce pages or website if you want to buy via online. </center></p>

<p> <center> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank"> <img src="instagram-logo.png" width="100" height="60"></center> </a>
Instagram is the best application if you're hobby is to post all of your pictures.
Instagram is the photo and video sharing social media, 
thus that you can upload or post all of your beautiful and aesthetic pictures from your camera or gallery. 
You can also use instagram to chat or to call someone like facebook messenger. Instagram is very easy to use.
You can also take a picture on instagram.</center></p>

<p> <center> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/" target="_blank"> <img src="tiktok.png" width="80" height="60"> </center> </a>
<center>Tiktok is the website or application that you can watch and create a video.
This website is my one my favorite websit, because you watch a video like dancing, singing.
But only short videos you can watch there, maximum of 5mins. There's so many insteresting videos there, that's why I watch tiktok everyday.
There's so many you can watch on tiktok like, inspirational videos, content creators, funny videos, game play videos, montage, etc.</center></p>

<p> <center> <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank"> <img src="netflix.png" width="80" height="60"></center> </a>
<center>Netflix is the website that you can watch all of your favorite movies or series. 
But netflix is not a free website, you need to buy a monthly account before you can watch movies. 
Netflix is the one of the best website to watch if you have money, because you can watch movies legally. 
The advantage of netflix in other movie websites is netflix has no any advertisement and feel free to watch legally. </center></p>
